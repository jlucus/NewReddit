# Work In progress
### Rules
1. Include your age, tag, [location], and what you looking for in the title:
Please include your age and TAG in your title. E.g. 22 [f4m], [m4f], [f4f], [m4m], [t4f], [t4m], [m4r], [f4r], [t4r]
Example:
> Title: 22[f4m] [Chicago], Illinois; or [Online]
> Posts without a descriptive title may be removed! See Rule 2 for details on Meetup vs Online posts.

>    Tagging Legend:
>    M– Male/Man
>    F– Female/Woman
>    MTF– Transwoman/male to female
>    FTM– Transman/female to male
>    A– Anyone/Redditor

2. Post titles must include [location] tag for meetups, [online] for online activities, or both:
If you're looking to meet, put your location in the title in the format [City], State/Province (including the comma, and with only one # before the city name). Specifying #State, Country, or just #Country, is also permitted, if you're willing to travel that whole area. Up to two such tags (including the Online tag) may be specified.

If you're seeking online activities, include the Online tag in your post title. You may optionally put a location if you're open to both.
